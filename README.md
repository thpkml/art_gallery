# art_gallery
A guide to make a very simple showcase website for your artworks with only HTML and CSS
## What
This is an extremely simple example of an art portfolio or art gallery website that can be built using plain HTML with some CSS. There is no programming logic involved, not even JS. 
## Why
Sometimes simple solution suffices. If complexity is not required, why make things complicated right? :) 
Since the site is purely informational, it can afford to be simple. 
## Who
This is aimed especially at students starting in front end web-development. With a bit of extra works here and there, it can even be used as a simple art portfolio to publish online!
## Usage
Feel free to use the codes as you like. Share if someone needs it.
